# cellular-automata

Simple cellular automata in Python.

# gol.py
Game of Life. The user can click individual squares to flip their state (dead/alive). In each generation, the state of each cell depends on its neighbors. The simulation can be stopped and started with spacebar.

# ca-terrain.py
Creates a random pattern on a square grid and then forms a "terrain" in steps. The algorithm leaves islands. In a final step, the borders between land and water are smoothed.

# ca-heat-eq.py

Shows heat diffusion by calculating the average for each cell at each generation.
